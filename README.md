# building-pipelines
In this project, machine learning pipelines were constructed for four different algorithms: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and Random Forest. Each pipeline encapsulates the entire machine-learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Here's a breakdown of the pipelines and their respective purposes:

### Naive Bayes Pipeline:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Includes tasks such as text vectorization (converting text data into numerical format), handling missing values, and scaling features if necessary.
2. **Naive Bayes Model Training:** Utilizes the preprocessed data to train a Naive Bayes classifier.
3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the Naive Bayes model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Decision Tree Pipeline:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Similar to the Naive Bayes pipeline, this step prepares the data for training.
2. **Decision Tree Model Training:** Trains a Decision Tree classifier using the preprocessed data.
3. **Evaluation:** Assesses the Decision Tree model's performance using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Linear Regression Pipeline:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Focuses on handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables if applicable.
2. **Linear Regression Model Training:** Trains a Linear Regression model on the preprocessed data to predict numerical outcomes.
3. **Evaluation:** Measures the Linear Regression model's performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared.

### Random Forest Pipeline:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Similar to the previous pipelines, this step prepares the data for training.
2. **Random Forest Model Training:** Trains a Random Forest regressor or classifier on the preprocessed data. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
3. **Evaluation:** Assesses the Random Forest model's performance using metrics specific to the task, such as RMSE for regression or accuracy for classification.

**Project Explanation:**
The goal of this project was to build and compare machine learning models using different algorithms on a given dataset. Each pipeline encapsulates the best practices for preprocessing data and training models specific to each algorithm. The models' performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics, allowing for a comprehensive comparison of Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and Random Forest algorithms in the context of the dataset used. This project aimed to identify the most suitable algorithm for the given task based on their respective performance metrics.
